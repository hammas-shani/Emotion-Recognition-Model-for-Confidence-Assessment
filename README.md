Emotion Recognition Model for Confidence Assessment

This project is an AI-based system that detects facial expressions and classifies them into Confidence and No-Confidence.
It uses a CNN model (TensorFlow/Keras) for training and OpenCV for face detection and video analysis.
The system takes video input, analyzes faces in real time, and displays percentage-based confidence results.
Technologies Used: Python, TensorFlow/Keras, OpenCV, NumPy, Scikit-learn
Features:
Train a CNN model for emotion classification
Detect faces in video using Haar Cascade
Classify expressions as Confidence or No-Confidence
Show percentage results on video frames
Save processed video with predictions
Future Scope:
Add more emotions like happy, sad, angry
Improve accuracy with larger datasets
Deploy as a web app with live camera input
